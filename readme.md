# mightyiam's Renovate config presets

These are mightyiam's [Renovate shareable config presets](https://docs.renovatebot.com/config-presets/).

These are meant to be used through GitHub. For example, in your `renovate.json`:

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "github>mightyiam/renovate-config:js-lib"
  ]
}
```

There is no version specified. Changes according to the convenience of the author are expected.

There are currently the following presets:

- `js-lib`: for JavaScript libraries
- `js-executable`: for JavaScript end-projects.
